# Driver-Contractor Assignment and Attendance System - Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document details all bugs identified and fixed in the driver-contractor assignment and attendance system, along with the improvements implemented to meet the specified requirements.

## üêõ Critical Bugs Identified and Fixed

### 1. Driver-Contractor Assignment Issues

#### Bug 1.1: Weak One-to-One Relationship Enforcement
**Issue**: The original system allowed multiple assignments and didn't properly enforce one-to-one relationships between drivers and contractors.

**Location**: `services/DriverAssignmentService.ts` lines 76-79
```typescript
// BEFORE (Buggy Code)
if (driverData.contractorId && driverData.contractorId !== params.contractorId) {
  throw new Error("Driver is already assigned to another contractor")
}
```

**Problem**: Only checked if driver was assigned to a different contractor, not if already assigned to the same contractor.

**Fix**: Enhanced validation with comprehensive constraint checking
```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed Code)
// Enforce one-to-one relationship: Check if driver is already assigned to ANY contractor
if (driverData.contractorId) {
  throw new Error(`Driver is already assigned to contractor: ${driverData.contractorName || 'Unknown'}`)
}

// Check for any active assignments in the assignments collection
const existingAssignmentsQuery = query(
  collection(FIRESTORE_DB, "driverAssignments"),
  where("driverId", "==", params.driverId),
  where("status", "==", "active")
)
const existingAssignments = await getDocs(existingAssignmentsQuery)

if (!existingAssignments.empty) {
  const existingAssignment = existingAssignments.docs[0].data()
  throw new Error(`Driver is already assigned to contractor: ${existingAssignment.contractorName || 'Unknown'}`)
}
```

#### Bug 1.2: Non-Admin Users Could Assign Drivers
**Issue**: Contractors could assign drivers to themselves, violating the admin-only requirement.

**Location**: `services/ContractorService.ts` line 501
```typescript
// BEFORE (Buggy Code)
assignedBy: contractorId, // Contractors could assign drivers
```

**Problem**: No permission validation for driver-contractor assignments.

**Fix**: Added admin-only validation and separated vehicle assignment from contractor assignment
```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed Code)
// Validate that assignedBy user is admin
const assignerDoc = await getDoc(doc(FIRESTORE_DB, "users", params.assignedBy))
if (!assignerDoc.exists()) {
  throw new Error("Assigner user not found")
}
const assignerData = assignerDoc.data()
if (assignerData.role !== 'admin') {
  throw new Error("Only admin users can assign drivers to contractors")
}
```

#### Bug 1.3: Inconsistent Assignment Data
**Issue**: Multiple assignment systems (`DriverAssignmentService` and `ContractorService`) created inconsistent data.

**Fix**: 
- Separated concerns: `DriverAssignmentService` handles contractor assignments (admin-only)
- `ContractorService` handles vehicle assignments (requires existing contractor assignment)
- Added transaction-based operations for data consistency

### 2. Attendance System Issues

#### Bug 2.1: Limited Dashboard Views
**Issue**: Dashboards only supported single-day views, missing date range and monthly views.

**Fix**: Implemented comprehensive view modes:
- Day view (existing)
- Date range view (new)
- Monthly view (new)
- Enhanced filtering by employee name

#### Bug 2.2: Insufficient Permission Checks
**Issue**: Attendance dashboards lacked proper permission validation.

**Fix**: Added role-based permission checks:
```typescript
// BEFORE
const { userData } = useRequireAuth(navigation)

// AFTER
const { userData, hasPermission } = useRequireAuth(navigation, { 
  requiredRole: 'swachh_hr',
  requiredPermission: 'canViewAllAttendance'
})
```

#### Bug 2.3: No Employee-Specific Filtering
**Issue**: HR users couldn't filter attendance by specific employees.

**Fix**: Added employee filter functionality with permission-based access:
```typescript
{hasPermission('canFilterAttendanceByEmployee') && (
  <Card style={styles.filterCard}>
    <Text style={styles.cardTitle}>Employee Filter</Text>
    <Searchbar
      placeholder="Filter by specific employee name..."
      onChangeText={setEmployeeFilter}
      value={employeeFilter}
    />
  </Card>
)}
```

## üîß System Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Permission System
Updated role permissions in `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:

```typescript
case 'admin':
  return {
    // ... existing permissions
    canAssignDriversToContractors: true,
    canViewAllAttendance: true,
    canManageDriverAssignments: true
  };

case 'transport_contractor':
  return {
    canManageDrivers: false, // Cannot assign drivers to themselves
    canAssignVehiclesToDrivers: true, // Can assign vehicles to already assigned drivers
    canViewAssignedDriverAttendance: true
  };

case 'swachh_hr':
  return {
    // ... existing permissions
    canViewAllAttendance: true,
    canFilterAttendanceByEmployee: true,
    canExportAttendanceData: true
  };
```

### 2. Enhanced Attendance Service
Created `getAttendanceForHRAndAdmin()` method with:
- Role-based access control
- Date range filtering
- Employee name filtering
- Comprehensive statistics generation

### 3. Improved UI Components
- Added view mode selector (Day/Range/Monthly)
- Implemented date range picker
- Added employee filter with clear functionality
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### 4. Data Consistency Improvements
- Implemented batch operations for atomic updates
- Added comprehensive validation methods
- Separated concerns between different assignment types
